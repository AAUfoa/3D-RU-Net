# 3D RU-Net

Code for the paper entitled "3D RoI-aware U-Net for Accurate and Efficient Colorectal Cancer Segmentation".
There will be 2 versions of it: One is implemented with Keras backended by Tensorflow, which is the case reported in the paper; another and the latest, is implmented with PyTorch, which more elegantly realizes the essential part of our algorithm.

Here are some results of colorectal cancer segmentation and illustration of other tasks, showing the scalability of the proposed method.

I'll get used to Github environment soon, and the code reorganization of Keras version will be completed by June 28th, 2018.
